# Temperature Converter App

## Output Format Explanation

The Temperature Converter program provides the converted temperature values in a specific output format. This README explains the reason for choosing this particular format.

### Output Format:
The converted temperature values are displayed in the following format:
- Celsius: X.XX
- Fahrenheit: X.XX
- Newton: X.XX

#### Reason for Choosing this Format:
1. **Clarity:** The format clearly labels each converted temperature with its corresponding scale, making it easy for users to identify and understand the results at a glance.
2. **Consistency:** By consistently displaying the converted temperatures in the same format for all scales, the output is more structured and easier to read.
3. **Precision:** The temperatures are rounded to two decimal places using the `.toFixed(2)` method to provide a reasonable level of precision without excessive decimal places.
4. **Conciseness:** The format uses a concise representation of the converted temperatures, eliminating unnecessary information and keeping the output clean and uncluttered.

I chose this output format to strike a balance between clarity, consistency, precision, and conciseness, ensuring that the converted temperature values are presented in a user-friendly and easily understandable manner.
